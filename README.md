Welcome,
Here we focus on php scripting projects and related coding.
The first one is the versatile calculator.

Implementation Approach
1. Overview
The PHP Calculator Application is designed to perform a variety of mathematical calculations, including basic arithmetic operations, exponentiation, percentage calculations, square root, and logarithms. The application consists of a user-friendly web interface and a backend PHP script to handle the calculations. This document outlines the implementation details and provides instructions for setting up and testing the application.
2. Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
•	calc.php: Handles user input, performs calculations, and displays results.
•	functions.php: Contains functions for specific calculations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
3. HTML Form 
The calc.php file contains the HTML form that has 
•	Text boxes for user input (two numbers).
•	Drop-down menu for selecting operations (+, -, *, /, ^).
•	Submit button to trigger calculations.
•	Display area for showing the result.
4. PHP Script (calc.php)
The calculate.php script processes the form data, performs the calculations based on the selected operation, and redirects back to the form with the result.
5. Instructions for Testing the Application
1. Setting Up the Application
1.	Web Server: Ensure you have  web server ,Apache with PHP support installed and running. You can use XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP for an easy setup on your local machine.
2.	Project Directory: Place the functions.php and calc.php files in the root directory of your web server i.e htdocs for XAMPP.
2. Testing the Application
1.	Open a Web Browser: Launch your preferred web browser.
2.	Navigate to the Application: Go to the URL where your calc.php file is located. For a local server, this might be http://localhost/calc.php.
3.	Input Values: Enter values into the form fields for the first number (num1) and, if required by the operation, the second number (num2).
4.	Select an Operation: Choose the desired operation from the dropdown menu.
5.	Submit the Form: Click the "Calculate" button to submit the form.
6.	View the Result: The result of the calculation will be displayed below the form.
3. Example Test Cases
1.	Addition:
o	Input num1: 10
o	Input num2: 5
o	Operation: Addition
o	Expected Result: 15
2.	Subtraction:
o	Input num1: 10
o	Input num2: 5
o	Operation: Subtraction
o	Expected Result: 5
3.	Multiplication:
o	Input num1: 10
o	Input num2: 5
o	Operation: Multiplication
o	Expected Result: 50
o	Expected Result: 2
